So it's important to know what you're signing up for when you're choosing an engineering  major, so I'll let you know about each one. Mechanical engineer means you make bombs,  civil engineer means you make targets, petroleum engineer means you make money,  chemical engineer means you're a chemist, being a chemist means you're a cashier at a pharmacy,  do not try to correct your confused family members, they will not understand.  Electrical engineer means you know that V equals IR, and the rest you can learn on the job.  Materials engineering is just coming up with IRL crafting recipes. Nuclear engineering is  trying to explain to everyone for the last 30 years that these are not chimneys.  You will be unsuccessful. Software engineering is trying to figure out if you qualify for food stamps.  Computer engineering is being relieved that you at least didn't choose software engineering.  By a medical engineering is when you just can't take it anymore, you need at least one class  with a girl in it. Mechanronics, oh I don't know how that got in there, that's not engineering.
